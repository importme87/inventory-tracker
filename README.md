 Inventory Tracker (First Python Project)

This is my **first Python project**, built during an introductory programming course.

It’s a simple program designed to help small businesses (like my family’s supermarket) **track inventory purchases** and filter them by item, category, date, or quantity.

## Features
- Add new purchases with item name, category, quantity, and date
- View all stored purchases
- Filter results by different criteria
- Save/load data (coming soon!)

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Run in a simple terminal/console environment

## Why I Built This
I’m new to coding and working toward a **career change into tech**. This project reflects both my learning and real-life business needs. It helped me practice Python while solving a real problem for our store.

## Status
Currently working on expanding this into a more full-featured inventory management app!
